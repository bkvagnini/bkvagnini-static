        <h2> Product Design / Management Artifacts</h2>
        <p><strong>Research > Requirements > User Stories > Retros > Iteration</strong></p>
        <p> The first step in Product Management is research. What do the users actually need? This research is conducted via informal interviews/requirements<br /> 
            gathering, asking "What is it you're trying to do here?"</p>
            <p> It may involve being on-site in their environment and observing them as they attempt to accomplish a specific task with a specific tool.</p>
            <p>It may involve discussions with their supervisors to determine what is needed.</p>

<p>This was for New Horizons Computer learning Center, when desktop scanners were still widely purchased. I had repeated requests for a scanner class and it did not exist in the Bew Horizons ecosystem. 
    I created the class, baseed on the questions my students were asking me. </p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<h4>User Research</h4>
<p>I would do a contextual site visit to observe officers while on patrol. <br />
    These officers, unlike their patrol car counterparts, do not have easy access to their laptops.<br />
    They face an additional challenge when spotting a suspicious car, in that they are unsure of whether or not the approaching person is the owner of the car. <br />
    They have expressed an interest in getting solid information about the car faster than calling it into dispatch to run down the plate.<br />
    The assumption is made that all these officers are issued a smart phone.</p>

<h4> User personas</h4>
<p>While I didn't sketch this out, I envisioned the officers and their experience levels. <br />
    I have Veteran Vern, who's been on the force for 15 years, and has had a weapon drawn on him three times, all during routine traffic stops. <br />
    I also have Newbie Nelson, who has just graduated from the academy, and is spending his first week on patrol, by himself. The horror stories of traffic stops gone wrong echo in his head with every footstep he takes. </p>


<h4>Ideation</h4>
<p>I considered all of the factors then sketched out a rouch sketch to verify that I didn't miss anything. I placed the Company logo on the bottom of the screen, as this is the absolute LAST piece of information an officer would need.
    I separated the Clear and Submit buttons, for the officers with large fingers, and I placed the Hit And Warrant text boxes as close to the top as possible, as this is the most critical information the officer needs in this scenario.
</p>

<div class = "proto">
<h4>Prototyping</h4>
<p> Created the mockup in Adobe XD</p>

    <figcaption>Default screen</figcaption>

    <figcaption>Bad guy</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img src = "portfolio/UX-UI/PC3000_good_dude_screen.PNG" alt="Good guy screen for Perp Catcher 3000 mobile app" />
    <figcaption>Good guy</figcaption>
</figure>
</div> <!-- End proto-->

<h4 class = "retro">Retrospective</h4>
<p> If I were making this now (or again), I would conduct a survery of officers that were using this app, and include a mix of experience levels (both for law enforcement and technology usage capabilities).  </p>
